# EventPlanner
This website is a simple day planner. A table filled with both the time and a form to enter an event for that hour. Then when the "save button is pushed, the entered event is saved and will persist through page reloads. 

The new technologies used are cool. Using features of outsite APIs, and some cool js tricks. First, moment is used to keep track of time, and to have a dynamically updating date. The other part that updates dynamically is the css, the past is styled differently than the present and future.

The second is the use of Bootstrap elements to make the construction easier. and a clever trick was employed to make it easy to add and remover table rows, where the js creates rows.
